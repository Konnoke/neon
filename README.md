#Neon Overview
Neon is a software platform designed to help integrate your disparate visualization widgets with your data stores. The **Data Access API** makes it easy for widgets to query NoSQL databases directly from JavaScript or RESTful endpoints, while still letting the server do the heavy lifting. The **Interaction API** provides capabilities for inter-widget communication, which easily links your widgets together. Neon does not provide any user interface components. Instead, Neon shines under-the-hood by removing the pressure from developers to figure out *how* to make different components work together and allowing them to focus more on the fun stuff, like creating valuable data exploration applications and workflows.
